# Perpetrator Trek Model Vignette 

John Collins was attributed to the Michigan Co-Ed Murderer series around Eastern Michigan University in the Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor areas of Michigan from 1967 to 1969. This case was used to illustrate the proposed perpetrator trek model as the locations where the victims were last seen was available through reports in local newspapers. The data used is presented in the table below. 

| **Victim Name**  | **Date**  | **Abandonment/Murder Site (Lat, Lon)** | **Encounter Site (Lat, Lon)** |

The mean area of overlap for the treks was also computed and assigned a weight of 25. These data were then used to determine the weighted mean prediction. This prediction point has an error distance of 1.18 miles from the residence of John Collins. A search area of 6.64 mi 2 was developed for the residence through iterations of the leave-n-out process. See the manuscripts for results of the computed weights, prediction, and comparison to other available systems.
